# Set 4 Game made by JM

This is Color Gambling Game I made for my midterm practical exam in FLutter. I posted this on my Github to practice and to adapt and make used to it. 


## Getting Started
	
I made few pages. Splash Art, Login page, Register Page, Welcome Home Page, and the Game Page.	
This is simple Game and it still doesnt have **database**, so my Login page and Register page is just made from condition and just a simple simulation.
